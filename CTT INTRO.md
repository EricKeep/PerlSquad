#### INITIAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

> What is the maximum number of genes encoded in each     genome?

Students work to answer this question by ‘finalizing’ a PERL-based annotation code, >that implements a closing Target Trimming algorithm, to >re-annotate the missing genes in their preferred genomes. 

#### INTENDED USER BASE
Academia, Bioinformatics Personnel. 

#### FIRST ADOPTER USER GROUP
Academia, Bioinformatics Personnel.

#### EQUIPMENT NEEDS

	Machine running Perl with required dependencies:
		Bioperl, BioPro, GeneWIse, Blast, HMMER
    
    Current Requirements:
        - Server to compile resulting executables,          
        - Provided by Dr. Hua. 
   
        - Create account on server so students can access files on server.
   
        - Tools/Server for Web-Site for developed stand alone program. 
   
        - Eventually, student research assistants along with other 
          professors for alpha/beta testing 

#### FEATURES
> Executable File:- specific to eukaryotic systems :- application is not web based
    
-  Application takes input from user in the firm of annotation file, sequence of proteins and family name.
    
- Application finds genome, then finds where previous annotation file missed genes and or potential new genes, translate new signs, using dependency GeneWise to use previous annotated sequences.
- Application outputs how many genes belong to input's family.
	: Genomic DNA Sequence, Annotation Transcript sequence, Peptide Sequence


#### INITIAL USE CASES / USAGE SCENARIOS
> To annotate duplicated genes that may have been missed in the initial .
> Currently not enough information for more specific use cases and scenarios, 
> Section will be updated at a later time. 

#### NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
> Security is not a priority, all code used will have open source propiety rights
> Dependencies and requirements for the program will be listed on the eventual site 
> and the executables FAQ.
