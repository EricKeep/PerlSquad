Meeting Notes
-Sounds for hovering over things in info screen (perhaps one per biome)
-Make sure the customization buttons are smaller than “Start”.
-Post-scroll-game feedback screen should be just like info screen pretty much
-Add a cue in the easy difficulty scroll game to let players know if they do something wrong

Post Questions
- None
